PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a peer-to-peer communication protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another single person or to multiple subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that one needs not inherently trust any entities such as root certificate
authorities. Bitmessage uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data ("meta-data"), 
such as the ID of sender and receiver of messages from passive eavesdroppers 
like those warrantless wiretapping programs which are ongoing.


Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests -
although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new
features, it is recommended that you first solicit feedback on the DevTalk
pseudo-mailing-list ("subscribe"): BM-2D9QKN4teYRvoq2fyzpiftPh9WP9qggtzh   
That list, however, is inactive by 2016.

Rather, join chan "bitmessage", BM-2cWy7cvHoq3f1rYMerRJp8PT653jjSuEdY   
which is visible here as well : http://beamstat.com/chan/bitmessage
